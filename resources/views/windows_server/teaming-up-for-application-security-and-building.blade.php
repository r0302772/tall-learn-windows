        We keep building on top of existing code, adding layers of abstraction, using combinations of different

    <h2>Red Team / Blue Team</h2>

        alt="" title="">

    <h3>Red Team</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>The cyber-security red team</strong> is composed of specialized personnel hired for their ethical
        hacking skills to find
        vulnerabilities in an organization‚Äôs security measures. Red team security consists of offensive security experts
        specialized in penetration testing of different systems. One of the critical phases in the development of a
        defensive mechanism against unauthorized intrusions is the testing stage. The testing phase involves the staging
        of comprehensive attacking exercises against the defensive mechanism to assess its effectiveness. People tasked
        with carrying out these exercises belong to a red team. They leverage their attacking skills to uncover any
        weakness in technology, people, and processes that may lead to unauthorized access to an organization‚Äôs digital
        estate.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some common examples of <strong>red team security exercises:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Penetration testing</strong> - Also referred to as ethical hacking, penetration testing is an
            activity where a red
            team tries to probe and infiltrate a secured system.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Social engineering</strong> - A process through which a red team tries to dupe an organization‚Äôs
            employee into
            providing access to a secured system.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Phishing</strong> - A red team acts by sending spoofed emails to an organization‚Äôs employees in an
            attempt to dupe
            them into clicking a fraudulent link that requests them to provide their login credentials.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Blue Team</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Blue team security</strong> involves a team of professionals responsible for devising and executing
        preventive mechanisms
        against unauthorized intrusions. A blue team is responsible for defending against real threats and red teaming.
        In case of a successful intrusion from a real attacker or red team, members of the blue team are there to study
        the techniques used in the attack and develop preventive mechanisms that will prevent future attacks of the same
        type. The blue team is continuously engaged in strengthening the digital security infrastructure of an
        organization using programs such as Intrusion Detected Systems (IDS).
    </p>

    <p>The following are the common exercises carried out under <strong>blue team cyber-security:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrying out DNS assessments to ensure that there are no phishing activities in the network or any general
            issue with DNS transactions.
        </li>
        <li>Conducting a footprint analysis to ensure that there are no unidentified signatures in the network that may
            signal a breach.
        </li>
        <li>Managing firewall access controls and end-point security software on devices such as workstations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purple Team</h2>

    <img
        src="/assets/img/windows_server/teaming_up_for_application_security_and_building/purple_team.png"
        alt="" title="">

    <p>
        <strong>Purple team security</strong> consists of more of a <strong>dynamic party between red and blue
            teams</strong> than a unit. It‚Äôs usually
        not a fixed team but often consists of people from both teams meeting up. Its purpose is to maximize the results
        of Red Team engagements and improve Blue Team capability.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is usually an already established, or created, effort within many security mature organizations. We‚Äôve
        learned from experience that the business works best when Red and Blue Teams work together to improve the
        security of the organization. There are many Purple Teams already in existence and people happily declare their
        joint effort to Purple Team. All because knowing both attack and defense is a huge asset to any organization,
        team and individual.
    </p>

    <h2>Yellow Team</h2>

    <img
        src="/assets/img/windows_server/teaming_up_for_application_security_and_building/yellow_team.png"
        alt="" title="">

    <p>
        These are the teams that build and design software, systems, and integrations. Application developers, software
        engineers and architects fall into this category.
    </p>

    <p>
        Their focus is usually on requirements, functionality, user experience and back-end performance. If we want to
        have applications, automations and processes designed and implemented securely, Red Team and Blue Team need to
        work with the Builders.
    </p>

    <h2>Orange Team</h2>

    <img
        src="/assets/img/windows_server/teaming_up_for_application_security_and_building/orange_team.png"
        alt="" title="">

    <p>
        The reason for many security bugs within software is not malicious programmers, but a lack of security awareness
        within software development teams and architects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of the Orange <strong>dynamic party</strong> is to <strong><i>inspire Yellow Team to be more
                security conscious, increasing their security awareness by providing education to benefit software code
                and design implementation.</i></strong> There should be structured and ongoing engagements between Red
        and Yellow Team for the benefit of Yellow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since Orange‚Äôs goal is to make developers think more like attackers, it will most likely start with certain Red
        Team members being available to Yellow Team. Working with developers to understand how attackers work will be
        the first step. A developer will then, in their brain, begin to <strong><i>internalise how to make their apps
                resistant</i></strong> to these types of attacks. Bringing in a Red or Orange Team member at the
        beginning of a software sprint allows for additional ‚ÄúHacker Stories‚Äù and ‚ÄúMis-use cases‚Äù to be developed
        alongside the team‚Äôs usual ‚ÄúUser Stories‚Äù and ‚ÄúUse cases‚Äù that Yellow Team would typically rely upon to make
        features. This gives Yellow Team immediate feedback on areas they need to secure before they write a single line
        of code.

    <h3>An example: A03 Injection (the SQL kind)</h3>

    <p>Scenario #1: An application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following vulnerable SQL call:</p>
    <pre>
String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'";
</pre>

    <p>Scenario #2: Blind trust in frameworks may result in queries that are still vulnerable:</p>
    <pre>
Query HQLQuery = session.createQuery("FROM accounts WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'");
</pre>

    <p>
        In both cases, the attacker modifies the ‚Äòid‚Äô parameter value in their browser to send: ‚Äò or ‚Äò1‚Äô=‚Äô1 For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
https://example.com/app/accountView?id=' or '1'='1
</pre>

    <p>This changes the meaning of both queries to return all the records from the accounts table.</p>

    </a>

    <h3>Pre-empting A03 Injection (the SQL kind)?</h3>

    <p>
        Main security control against SQL injection: ‚ÄòQuery parameterization and binding‚Äô ÔÉ† Prepared statements are a
        form of query parameterization
    </p>

    <p>
        Scenario #1: The following code example uses a PreparedStatement, Java's implementation of a parameterized
        query:
    </p>
    <pre>
String query = "SELECT account_balance FROM user_data WHERE user_name = ? ";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, custname);
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();
</pre>

    <p>Scenario #2: Use the correct functions of the framework:</p>
    <pre>
Query HQLQuery = session.createQuery("from Inventory where productID=:productid");
HQLQuery.setParameter("productid", userSuppliedParameter);
</pre>

    <p>
        Blue Team are not always aware of all the frameworks, libraries, third-party systems, network calls, and
        functionality added by Yellow Team.
    </p>

    <p>Yellow Team may sometimes be <i>barely aware of some of the dependencies behind their own code.</i></p>

    <p>
        In the event of an incident, Blue Team may <strong><i>not have the data needed to investigate</i></strong> or
        <strong><i>defend breached systems</i></strong>, and no one wants to test or touch the production environment
        for fear of it breaking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Green Team is another <strong>dynamic party</strong> that consists of ongoing structured interactions between
        the Blue Team and
        members of the software team, the Yellow Team. <strong>The ultimate goal is to improve code-based and
            design-based
            defense capability</strong> for detection, incident response, and data forensics.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Yellow Team working with Blue Team, catching an event before it becomes an incident, before it becomes a
        breach, is essential to the defense of any organization. In other words, <strong>pre-empting incidents</strong>.

    <h3>Green Sec. Pre-empting: OWASP Pro-Active Controls</h3>

    <p>
        OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls for Software Developers focus more on defensive techniques and controls, as
        opposed to risks.
        You can find the document with controls on the OWASP website <a
            href="https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/">here</a>.

    <p>
        This document is organized with controls, and the naming reflects: C01, C02, C03, ‚Ä¶ C10. These controls are
        considered the most important and categories that every architect and developer should absolutely, 100% include
        in every project.

    <h3>C2: Leverage Security Frameworks and Libraries</h3>

    <p>You have to implement a lot of security controls! Stand on the shoulders of Giants in the Dev-world!</p>

    <p>
        Use native secure features before 3rd party libraries, for example, <a
            href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-security">Spring Security</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Or, use Open Source security libraries and frameworks that are well vetted. Always remember to keep them
        updated!

                Series</a> for a collection of cheat sheets covering various security topics.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C4: Encode and Escape Data</h3>

    <p>Protecting against XSS attacks is critical. Follow these practices:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Refer to the <a
                href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#rule-2-encode-data"
                target="_blank">OWASP Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet</a> for insights on encoding data to prevent
            injection attacks.
        </li>
        <li>Guard against XSS vulnerabilities by using HTML sanitizers and tools like <a
                href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify" target="_blank">DOMPurify</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Be cautious when using the .innerHTML function in JavaScript, as HTML manipulation can be tricky.</li>
        <li>Frameworks often provide auto-escaping features; leverage them to enhance security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C5: Validate All Inputs</h3>

    <p>Ensure the security of your application by validating all inputs. Here's what you can do:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Understand and implement input validation using the <a
                href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html" target="_blank">OWASP
                Input Validation Cheat Sheet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Make use of the validation options offered by your framework, but be aware of potential flaws.</li>
        <li>Employ Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools for
            effective discovery of XSS vulnerabilities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dynamic & Static Application Security Testing</h3>

    <img
        src="/assets/img/windows_server/teaming_up_for_application_security_and_building/dynamic_and_static_application_security_testing_1.png"
        alt="" title="">

    <img
        src="/assets/img/windows_server/teaming_up_for_application_security_and_building/dynamic_and_static_application_security_testing_2.png"
        alt="" title="">

    <p><strong>Static Application Security Testing (SAST):</strong></p>
    <p>
        SAST is a white-box testing method that analyzes source code from the inside, examining components while they
        are at rest.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):</strong></p>
    <p>
        DAST, also known as a web application vulnerability scanner, is a black-box security test. It simulates external
        attacks on an application while the application is running, attempting to penetrate it from the outside by
        checking exposed interfaces for vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a list of DAST tools, refer to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools"
                                              target="_blank">OWASP's Vulnerability Scanning Tools</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The dynamic aspect of DAST testing comes from its execution in a dynamic environment. Unlike SAST, which scans
        an application's code line by line when the application is at rest, DAST testing is performed while the
        application is running. While DAST can be used in production, testing is usually carried out in a QA
        environment.

    <h3>C8: Protect Data Everywhere</h3>

    <p>Data in Transit: Remember HTTPS?</p>
    <p>Data at Rest (in storage):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use standard well-vetted crypto libraries (Lipsodium, Tink)</li>
        <li>Use a form of secrets management to protect application secrets and keys (<a href="https://vaultproject.io/"
                                                                                         target="_blank">vaultproject.io</a>)

    <h3>C9: Implement Security Logging and Monitoring</h3>

    <p>Provide traceability! Remember: Incident Response, forensics = work as a team!</p>

    <p>Three main things to log:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Any and all input validation failures = Someone tries to enter something strange into a field</li>
        <li>Any and all authentication events = Successful and failed log-ins</li>
        <li>Any and all access control failures = Someone tries to access something they shouldn‚Äôt</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Building Secure Applications üî®</h3>

    <p>Do we need to build every application to turn it into something runnable?</p>

    <p>Interpreted Languages: Python, JavaScript, PHP, ‚Ä¶</p>
    <p>
        The instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other
        program, an interpreter.
    </p>

    <p>Compiled Languages: Java, C#, C, C++, ‚Ä¶</p>
    <p>Need a ‚Äúbuild‚Äù step, they need to be manually compiled first.</p>
    <p>Are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute.</p>
    <p>
        <code>mvn package</code> or <code>mvn verify</code> for Java (with Maven), <br> <code>dotnet build</code> for
        C#
    </p>

    <p>Compiled or interpreted, an application can be transported, delivered and ran in a Docker container</p>
    <p>You should really get to know this‚Ä¶</p>

    <p>Not straightforward to set up on Windows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a Linux VM on VirtualBox. Nice to try stuff out but not that handy to develop</li>
        <li>Using Docker Desktop based on Windows Subsystem for Linux. Nice to develop but does not work alongside
            VirtualBox
