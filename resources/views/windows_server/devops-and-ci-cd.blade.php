        <p>DevOps has grown to be an omnipresent and important term in IT, even though the specific meaning people give
            to
            it can differ a lot. Despite these differences, one is able to spot a few general underlying aspects that
            can
            define a â€˜DevOps cultureâ€™ and can bring us closer to understanding this term.</p>

        <p>We will start off from the 5 points on how Google sees DevOps culture:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Reduce organization silos:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Development teams, infrastructure teams, â€¦ need to start thinking and communicating as one team
                        and
                        move towards actually forming one team
                    </li>
                    <li>Developers need to have knowledge about operations and operations need to have knowledge about
                        development
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Accept failure as normal:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement fail-safes from the start during coding and deployment and see the occurrence of
                        failures
                        as a certainty in the long term
                    </li>
                    <li>Do not play the blame game when a failure does lead to larger problems but see how a fail-safe
                        can
                        be implemented
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Implement gradual change:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make small changes in code easier by using automation so that a code change does not lead to a
                        heap
                        of work every single time
                    </li>
                    <li>Reduce the need for hellish crunch months having huge changes right before releases</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Measure everything:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatic monitoring for security, capacity or other incidents is essential to implement gradual
                        changes fast and solve these incidents
                    </li>
                    <li>Detailed monitoring brings new insights into the usage of different application features and
                        user
                        interest
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Leverage tooling & automation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use automation tools to help the other points come into reality</li>
                    <li>Standardize tools and working methods to bring development and operations closer together</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>You will probably notice that these 5 points overlap and are tied to each other. This is not a surprise as we
            were still talking about DevOps culture. These ideas need to get implemented into organizations in various
            ways
            and degrees by using DevOps tools or methodologies.</p>

        <p>A well-known methodology is Agile, with one of its core aspects being gradual changes and development in
            sprints.</p>

        <p>However, DevOps is usually most recognized for the tooling that automates the entire process of application
            development and operations, from the coding up until the eventual monitoring of a running application. This
            sequence of implemented automatic steps and tools is often called a DevOps pipeline. The rest of this
            chapter
            will be dedicated to this pipeline and the tools it contains.</p>

        <p>Google itself has SRE teams which are essentially focused on operations and less on development. Thatâ€™s also
            why
            the implementation of the DevOps culture in these parts of Google will differ a bit from how we implement it
            to
            start off with. You can see their implementation as SRE <a
